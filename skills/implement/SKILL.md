## Algorithm

```
Check what is already in your own context, before reading anything.

IF this session has already driven a milestone to DONE, or carries
substantial work unrelated to the milestone about to run:
    STOP — tell the human to /clear and re-invoke this skill.
    Do not read requirements, architecture or milestones first:
    those reads, and every dispatch after them, are exactly what
    a carried context makes you pay twice for. See "And one
    session per milestone" below.

Read .harness/requirements.md

IF missing:
    tell the user to run the roast-requirements skill first
    STOP

IF Open Questions != None, or material ambiguity remains:
    STOP and tell the user what's unresolved

Read .harness/architecture.md

IF present AND Status != AGREED:
    STOP — the architecture is still DRAFT; tell the user to finish the
    architect skill and agree it

IF absent:
    proceed normally — architecture is optional, and its absence is expected
    when extending an existing codebase. Do not generate one; it needs human
    agreement, which is the architect skill's job.

Read `.harness/state.json` first. It is the workflow authority and identifies the
one current milestone. Then read only that milestone's section from
`.harness/milestones.md`, which is the compact human view.

IF `.harness/state.json` is missing but `.harness/milestones.md` exists:
    run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/migrate-state.py
    .harness/milestones.md .harness/state.json --requirements
    .harness/requirements.md` once. If it reports ambiguous ownership, STOP and
    ask the human for the explicit id-to-milestone JSON map required by
    `--ownership`; never guess ownership
    validate it with `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-state.py
    .harness/state.json --milestones .harness/milestones.md
    --requirements .harness/requirements.md`
    STOP on any migration or consistency error rather than guessing

Read .harness/milestones.md

IF missing:
    invoke harness:orchestrator to do reconnaissance and generate milestones

    IF it returns BLOCKED: STOP and report to the human. Generation does not
    hand off — a milestones.md covering half the requirements is
    indistinguishable downstream from a complete one, so the orchestrator
    writes the plan in full or writes nothing. BLOCKED here means it could
    not, and the recon it recorded is what the next attempt starts from.

    Before entering the LOOP, confirm both files exist, every template heading
    is present, and `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-state.py
    .harness/state.json --milestones .harness/milestones.md
    --requirements .harness/requirements.md` passes.

LOOP:
    find the first milestone that is not DONE

    For every subagent invocation below, validate its return contract before
    acting on it. A response missing its required terminal field is
    `INTERRUPTED`, including a response cut off by the runtime's hard turn cap.
    Never infer PASS, FAIL or completion from an interrupted response. Re-enter
    through repository state in a fresh agent; if no resumable state was written,
    stop and report the interrupted role rather than guessing what it changed.

    IF none exists (all DONE):
        run `python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-state.py .harness/state.json
        --milestones .harness/milestones.md --requirements
        .harness/requirements.md --all-done`. This checks that every
        in-scope requirement is owned, every milestone is DONE, every criterion
        passed and no blocking finding remains. Report completed milestone ids,
        review/validation artifact paths, follow-ups, branch and commits; then STOP.
        Do not invoke another reviewer or rerun project-wide validation.

    IF it is BLOCKED:
        STOP — report the milestone's escalation contract to the human, do not
        skip ahead to a later milestone

    IF its Status is TODO or IN_PROGRESS:
        invoke harness:orchestrator for the IMPLEMENTATION phase
        (recon, size/shape check, task breakdown, routing by tier,
        Red→Green→Refactor, focused validation, evidence recording — see
        ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/orchestrator.md for what it does)

        it returns the milestone at REVIEW, or SPLIT, or CONTINUE, or BLOCKED

        IF SPLIT: continue the LOOP — it found the milestone oversized, split
        it in milestones.md, and implemented nothing. The loop now picks up
        the first part.

        IF CONTINUE: the phase is unfinished and the orchestrator handed off
        at its context ceiling, having recorded what it completed in
        milestones.md. Invoke a FRESH harness:orchestrator for the SAME phase.
        Cap this at 4 continuations per phase; past that, STOP and report to
        the human that the milestone does not fit its phase budget and needs
        splitting.

        (The cap was 3 while a phase ran until its context felt full — in
        practice 145k-210k tokens. The orchestrator now hands off at 20 turns,
        which it can actually count, so phases are shorter and continuations
        more frequent. 5 phases x 20 turns is a comparable total: across 63
        measured invocations only 2 ran longer than that, and both were the
        oversized milestones this cap exists to surface.)

    WHILE its Status is REVIEW:
        IF ### Review Cycles is already 2 and a BLOCKER or IMPORTANT
        finding recorded there is still open:
            the cap is spent. Do NOT invoke a reviewer — a third review is
            the thing the cap forbids, and it is checked here because here
            is where reviews are invoked.
            invoke harness:orchestrator to ESCALATE, saying the cap is
            spent and passing no report path. It sets BLOCKED and writes
            the escalation contract, and routes nothing.
            STOP — report the escalation contract to the human.

        invoke a FRESH harness:reviewer at the tier derived below, scoped
        per "What a second review sees" — you invoke it, not the
        orchestrator. Give it `.harness/reviews/M<n>-cycle<c>.md` as the report
        path. It writes there only when changes are required. On a retry after
        an unfinished review, also give it `<that path>.partial.md` when the
        file exists.

        IF it returns INCOMPLETE, or any response missing the `Result:`
        field its envelope contract requires:
            the review did not happen. `maxTurns` cut it off mid-generation,
            which is why the terminal field is absent.
            This is the general rule at the top of the LOOP, not a special
            case: `INTERRUPTED` is defined by the missing terminal field
            alone. Do not additionally require the verdict and the table to
            be absent — the cut-off can land *inside* the envelope, after a
            verdict or after per-criterion rows, and a partly-formed envelope
            is the one shape the branches below would otherwise consume as
            though it were whole.
            Do NOT mine the truncated text for findings, however complete
            it looks — a partly-formed envelope looks most complete exactly
            when it is most dangerous. A partial look formatted as a verdict
            is the precise failure this role exists to prevent.
            confirm HEAD is unmoved and that nothing changed outside the
            three artifacts a review may leave: `<report path>.partial.md`,
            the report path itself, and
            `.harness/evidence/<milestone>-review.log`. Do NOT require a
            clean tree — a review that reached its first criterion is
            supposed to have left a partial behind, and demanding a clean
            tree would reject every retry the partial exists to make cheap.
            A review corrects nothing, so a change anywhere else means
            something other than the review ran: STOP and report that
            instead of retrying.
            A complete report may sit at the path even though nothing
            terminal came back — the cut-off can land after the write. That
            is still not a review: the completion gate consumes the returned
            envelope, not the file, and you must not read the file to
            reconstruct one. The retry overwrites it.
            Do NOT increment ### Review Cycles. The cap counts reviews whose
            findings were routed and fixed; this one routed nothing, so it has
            not happened yet — the same rule the fix cycle's CONTINUE branch
            applies below.
            invoke a FRESH harness:reviewer for the SAME cycle, at the SAME
            tier, with the SAME scope and report path, plus the partial.
            Cap this at 2 retries per cycle. Past that, STOP and report that
            the review does not fit a reviewer's turn budget and needs
            narrowing or a human decision. (2 is what the one measured
            occurrence needed — attempts 1 and 2 lost, attempt 3 passing —
            and that was before the reviewer persisted anything or was told
            not to poll a long suite.)

        ON ANY TERMINAL VERDICT — PASS or CHANGES REQUIRED — delete
        `<report path>.partial.md` once the envelope is in your hands. The
        reviewer never deletes it: a cut-off landing between its delete and
        its return would erase the only resumable state there is. You are the
        one party that can tell a review finished, so you are the one that
        cleans up after it.

        IF it returns PASS:
            apply the completion gate yourself — it is mechanical:
              - every acceptance criterion in the milestone entry has a row
                in the reviewer's per-criterion table, and every row is PASS
              - no BLOCKER or IMPORTANT finding remains
            IF either check fails: treat the verdict as CHANGES REQUIRED —
            a PASS that does not cover every criterion is the failure this
            gate exists for, not a formality
            otherwise:
              - delete any file at `<report path>`. A passing review writes
                none, so a file there is the `CHANGES REQUIRED` report of a
                superseded attempt that was cut off after writing it. Left
                alone it is committed with the DONE milestone and describes
                an outcome that did not happen.
              - check every acceptance criterion off as [x], against the
                reviewer's per-criterion row and nothing else. A milestone
                that is DONE with criteria still unchecked contradicts its
                own record, and the boxes are what a human reads first.
              - record the verdict and the review tier under ### Review
              - finalise the passing milestone exactly as described under
                "Finalising a passing milestone" below; that records any
                as-built artifact before setting DONE and closing the branch
            Do NOT increment ### Review Cycles — a review that passes is
            the verdict that ends the loop, not a cycle. Only a review
            whose findings were routed and fixed counts, which is what
            makes the cap countable.
            Do NOT invoke the orchestrator. There is nothing to route, and
            instantiating a coordinator to find that out was six no-op
            invocations on the one project this was measured on.

        IF it returns CHANGES REQUIRED:
            confirm its compact envelope names the report path and that the file
            exists. Do NOT write, read, quote or reproduce the report yourself.

            IF Scope is RECORD_ONLY:
                record the pre-correction commit, apply only the mechanical state
                corrections named by finding id, and commit their explicit
                `.harness/` paths. Run `python3
                ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-state.py .harness/state.json
                --requirements .harness/requirements.md --record-only <pre> HEAD`
                plus the normal state/index check. If
                both pass and the original
                per-criterion rows were all PASS, record the resolved finding ids,
                then finalise the passing milestone exactly as described under
                "Finalising a passing milestone" below. Do not invoke a worker,
                orchestrator, reviewer, live proof or broad validation for the
                correction itself. If either check fails, treat the scope as
                SUBSTANTIVE rather than arguing with the checker.

            IF Scope is SUBSTANTIVE:
                invoke a FRESH harness:orchestrator for ONE fix cycle, passing
                the PATH and not the report body (findings re-emitted into a
                prompt are the same defect task packets had before M4b)

                it returns the milestone at REVIEW, CONTINUE or BLOCKED —
                never DONE

                IF CONTINUE: the fix cycle hit its turn budget with corrections
                still outstanding. It has NOT incremented Review Cycles, because
                the cycle has not happened yet. Invoke a FRESH harness:orchestrator
                for the SAME fix cycle, passing the SAME report path. Cap this at
                4 continuations per cycle; past that, STOP and report that the
                findings do not fit a cycle's budget and need splitting or a human
                decision. Do NOT invoke the reviewer between continuations — that
                is the half-corrected re-review this branch exists to prevent.

                IF it returns REVIEW without Review Cycles having increased,
                or with Review Cycles above 2:
                    STOP — the cap is not being honoured and the loop would not
                    terminate. Report it to the human as a harness defect.

    IF BLOCKED: STOP — report the escalation contract to the human
    (BLOCKED means it hit the 2-cycle review/fix cap with unresolved
    BLOCKER/IMPORTANT findings, or needs a human planning decision)

    A successful finalisation stops this invocation. Report its outcome and tell
    the user to /clear and re-invoke this skill for the next milestone. Do not
    continue the LOOP in this context. The LOOP is re-entered from structured
    state on the next invocation and picks up where this one stopped.
```

## Invoking the reviewer

Every review is invoked from here, with a fresh context, and given only the inputs
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/reviewer.md` asks for — requirements, the milestone
and its acceptance criteria, the diff, relevant surrounding code, validation
results. Never implementation discussion, rationale, or any orchestrator's
justification.

Give it the exact report path under `.harness/reviews/` that a
`CHANGES REQUIRED` verdict should create. The reviewer writes the full artifact
and returns only its verdict, path, per-criterion statuses and finding counts.
On `PASS` it writes no file. Never ask for the findings inline and never relay
their body through this context.

Derive review tier from the substantive material in this review's diff, not from
the highest tier ever used in the milestone. For cycle 1, inspect task routing
records for the implementation diff. For later cycles, inspect only correction
tasks since the recorded `Pre-correction` ref. A record-only correction dispatches
no reviewer and inherits no tier.

```
highest current substantive tier      reviewer runs at
Cheap  (haiku)                     →  sonnet (review floor)
Mid    (sonnet)                    →  sonnet
Top    (opus)                      →  opus
```

`sonnet` remains the semantic-review floor. Use Opus only when the current diff
contains an Opus-routed task, architecture/security work, or difficult
concurrency. Record `tier`, `model`, `reason_code`, diff range and cycle in the
structured review entry. An older Opus task outside the correction diff cannot
elevate a narrow Sonnet correction review.

## What a second review sees

A cycle-1 review reads the whole milestone. **A cycle-2 review reads the
correction diff — and grades every acceptance criterion, exactly as cycle 1 did.**
What narrows is the reading, not the grading.

That distinction is the whole rule, and getting it wrong deadlocks the loop. The
completion gate above requires a per-criterion row for **every** criterion in the
milestone, so a review that returns rows only for the criteria a correction
touched fails the gate with no finding for a fix cycle to route — burning a cycle
of the cap on a milestone that was correct. Re-grading costs almost nothing: the
reviewer re-runs the milestone's validation and its entry point, which it must do
anyway rather than credit the record. Re-reading a milestone diff that cycle 1
already read is what costs, and that is what stops.

Pass the reviewer the **correction diff** as a range it can run:
`git diff <Pre-correction> HEAD`, where `Pre-correction` is the ref the fix cycle
recorded under `### Review` before it routed anything, alongside the files the
corrections changed. That range is the scope.

**A list of filenames is not a diff.** `git diff <Baseline> -- <files>` returns
those files' original implementation *as well as* the correction, which is the
whole milestone read under a narrower name. The ref is what makes the scope a
range, and it exists because a milestone runs on its own branch with every
accepted task and correction committed — see "Git discipline in the target
repository" in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/orchestrator.md`.

If `### Review` records no `Pre-correction` ref, there is no correction diff to
scope to: review the whole milestone and record that the ref was missing. (Older
cycles recorded a `.patch` file instead; if one is named, it is that cycle's
correction diff.)

**Widen back to the whole milestone if the corrections changed a file no cycle-1
finding named.** The scope rests entirely on "nothing else changed", and a
correction that wandered outside its findings falsifies that. The fix cycle is
required to record such a file explicitly; if `### Review` does not say either way,
treat it as widened rather than assuming.

Do not skip the second review because cycle 1 found nothing serious. Corrections
carry their own defects: on the one project this has been measured, a review scoped
to a single correction cost a fraction of a full one and found a `BLOCKER` — a
guard test that asserted nothing — where most full-scope cycle-2 reviews found
nothing above `OPTIONAL`. Scope is what makes the second review worth running;
skipping it is not.

## Finalising a passing milestone

Run this only after the completion gate has passed, including after a valid
record-only correction:

1. If `.harness/architecture.md` exists, invoke `harness:as-built` in RECORD mode
   with the milestone number, baseline and Architecture field. It writes
   `.harness/as-built/M<n>.md`. Record its returned path and one-line result in
   both `.harness/state.json` and the milestone's `### As-Built` field without
   reading the artifact. If it returns `BLOCKED`, record that result and carry
   on; this record is evidence, not another completion gate.
2. Set the milestone to `DONE` in both state views and run the normal
   `check-state.py` consistency check with `--requirements
   .harness/requirements.md`.
3. Close the milestone branch as described below. The closing commit therefore
   includes the as-built artifact, structured state and human milestone update
   together. There must be no `.harness/` write after this commit.
4. Stop this invocation.

## Closing the milestone branch

A milestone runs on the branch the implementation phase opened, with every
accepted task and correction committed to it. When the milestone reaches `DONE`:

**Commit the milestone record you just updated** — `git add .harness && git
commit -m "M<n> DONE: <outcome>"`. By path, not `git add -A`: a review run leaves
`__pycache__/` and other build artefacts behind, and `-A` commits them into the
human's history. The branch then ends clean, and the next milestone opens on a
tree that is not carrying this one's paperwork as if it were pre-existing work.
If `git status --porcelain` shows anything besides `.harness/`, report it rather
than sweeping it in: an artefact wants a `.gitignore` entry, and source left
uncommitted means a task escaped the commit rule.

**Keep the independently verified commits.** They are deliberately more granular
than a human might write: each is an auditable state the verifier accepted. Do
not squash them or use any form of reset to tidy history. Everything before
`### Baseline` is history you did not create. **Do not merge the branch, delete
it, or push it** —
integrating a milestone is the human's decision and may go through a pull
request, a review, or a policy nothing here can see. The next milestone branches
from wherever `HEAD` is, so a chain of milestone branches needs none of that.

Report the branch name when you hand back, so the human knows where the work is.

## One invocation per phase, not per milestone

Each `harness:orchestrator` invocation above is a **separate context**, and that
is the point rather than an implementation detail. Run as one invocation, a
milestone's review phase costs most of its total, because every review turn
re-pays for the whole implementation phase sitting underneath it.

`.harness/milestones.md` is the handoff. It is already required to be enough for a
new session to resume, so this costs nothing to maintain; it only requires that the
loop above actually re-invoke rather than let one context run on. Do not collapse
these back into one invocation to save a round trip — the round trip is cheap and
the context it discards is not.

## And one session per milestone, not per project

The same argument applies one level up, to **your own** context. You are the
session running this skill, and nothing about a finished milestone helps you
run the next one — `milestones.md` already carries everything that does.

A session that runs two milestones carries the first one's history through every
turn of the second, for turns that do nothing but dispatch phases and read their
returns — several times what a fresh session pays for identical work.

So the LOOP stops at each milestone boundary and hands back to the human. Tell
them to `/clear` before re-invoking. This is not a limitation to work around by
carrying on anyway: the milestone boundary is the cheapest context boundary in
the system, and it is free precisely because the state file is already required
to survive it.

**And it is checked on the way in, not only on the way out.** Stated only as an
exit instruction, this rule lost to a session that simply never ended: one phase
was dispatched from a session opened the previous day and already carrying 276k
tokens, and cost 4.6 times what the identical work cost from a fresh session
immediately afterwards. The Algorithm therefore opens by checking its own context
and refusing to start, because the human who has to act on the instruction is not
the one who reads it.

The check is provenance, not a token count: a session cannot reliably measure its
own size, but it can see whether it has already done a milestone's work. That is
the condition that actually failed, so that is the condition to test.

## Never

- Never mark a milestone or the implementation complete because an
  agent (worker, orchestrator, or yourself) merely claims it's done. Completion
  requires the reviewer's evidence-based sign-off recorded in `.harness/milestones.md`.
- Never skip the requirements gate to "save time" — an unresolved material
  question left unblocked here becomes wasted or wrong implementation later.
- Never continue past a `BLOCKED` milestone to a later one. Milestones build on
  each other; skipping ahead defeats the point of ordering them.
- Never loop a milestone review/fix cycle more than twice — escalate to the
  human instead.
- Never delegate a lookup to `Explore`, `general-purpose`, or any agent other
  than `harness:navigator`. See "Delegate your lookups" above.
- Never write a review report yourself, or copy one through your context to get
  it onto disk. The reviewer writes it to the path you gave it; you carry a
  verdict, a per-criterion table and that path. This has happened: one session
  read the source itself, diagnosed the defect, and authored a 6,414-character
  findings report with numbered BLOCKERs at `.harness/reviews/M12-cycle1.md` —
  a reviewer's artefact produced by the one context that is not independent of
  the work.
- Never root-cause a defect yourself. Reproducing a bug, reading the source to
  find why, bisecting a build — that is a task to route, and the diagnosis is
  worth what the context producing it is worth. Yours has read every dispatch
  and return in this milestone, which is exactly the context a fresh reviewer or
  worker is given specifically to avoid.
- Never push a milestone branch, merge it, delete it, or rewrite history the
  harness did not create. See "Closing the milestone branch" above.
- Never run another harness skill from this session — not `roast-requirements`
  to act on a requirements problem you found mid-implement, not `architect`.
  Record it and hand back for a `/clear`.
- Never copy an as-built diagram into `.harness/milestones.md` or into your own
  report. The milestone record carries a path; the diagram stays in its file. A
  diagram pasted into shared state is re-read by every session that follows.
- Never let the implementation and an agreed `.harness/architecture.md` drift
  apart silently. By the end, the architecture must describe what was actually
  built — either because the code matches it, or because every departure is
  recorded under its `## Deviations`.
