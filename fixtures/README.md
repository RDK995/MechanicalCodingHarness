# Behavioural fixtures

Scenarios with verified-correct outcomes, retained so the harness's behaviour can
be re-checked — after changing the plugin, or when running a role on a different
model.

## What a fixture is

A starting repository state plus an expected outcome that was independently
verified when the scenario was first run. Not a unit test: the thing under test is
an agent, so some expectations are mechanically checkable (`Status: BLOCKED`
appears in `milestones.md`) and some require reading the report (the reviewer
identified *this* violation for *this* reason). Each `EXPECTED.md` separates the two.

## Running one

Fixtures are templates. Running mutates the directory, so copy it out first and
run the copy — the retained fixture is never the thing that runs.

```bash
cp -R fixtures/03-drift-undeclared /tmp/run-03
cd /tmp/run-03
rm EXPECTED.md                                          # never run with the answer key present
git init -q && git add -A && git commit -qm baseline    # some fixtures need a diff
```

**Remove `EXPECTED.md` from the copy before running.** It states the expected
finding — for `03`, the exact one — and the agent explores the directory it runs
in. A fixture whose answer sits next to the question discriminates nothing.

Then run the command in that fixture's `EXPECTED.md`, pointing at this plugin:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/this/repo --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  --allowedTools "Read Write Edit Bash Grep Glob Task Agent" \
  -p "/harness:implement"
```

Run from a path outside `~/.claude/`. Paths under it are treated as sensitive and
writes are blocked, which looks like a harness failure and isn't (recorded in B8).

## The fixtures

| Fixture | Discriminates | First validated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `01-requirement-violation` | Does the reviewer catch a requirement violation, and refuse to mark an untested criterion proven? | B6 |
| `02-loop-cap` | Does contradictory work reach `BLOCKED` instead of looping or faking a pass? (**Its two-cycle expectation no longer holds — see below.**) | B11 |
| `03-drift-undeclared` | Is a silently dissolved component boundary caught **while every test passes**? | B13 |
| `04-drift-declared` | Is the same departure, once recorded, correctly *not* a finding? | B13 |
| `05-golden-path` | Baseline: does the whole workflow still work at all? | B8, B14, 2026-08-27 |
| `06-impossible-criterion` | Given a criterion no code can satisfy, does the harness prove the impossibility, decline to spend the retry ladder on it, and escalate with an actionable decision — instead of faking green? | B17 |
| `07-layered-temptation` | Given an architecture that divides cleanly by tier, does planning produce thin end-to-end slices — or one milestone per component? | B22 |
| `08-cap-already-spent` | With two review/fix cycles already recorded and a finding still open, does the harness escalate — or quietly start a third? | B25 |
| `09-vacuous-pass` | Given a worker's false `PASS` backed by a genuinely green command, does the verifier catch that the command proved nothing — and that the claimed change never landed? | B25 |
| `10-as-built-drift` | Per-milestone as-built recording from its diff, and reviewer detection of undeclared divergence | B27 |
| `11-correction-wandered` | When a correction edits a file no finding named, does the second review widen back to the whole milestone — or pass a correct-looking correction that broke the entry point? | 2026-08-25 |
| `12-scoped-second-review` | When a correction stays inside its finding, does the second review stay scoped, and does a passing review complete the milestone without instantiating a coordinator? | 2026-08-25 |
| `13-operationally-oversized` | Does a low-criterion milestone with several lifecycle/concurrency responsibilities split before tasks are created? | token-efficiency v2 |
| `14-dispatch-collect` | Does the orchestrator block on `TaskOutput` to collect a dispatch, instead of ending its turn and being re-entered with a fresh turn allowance — and does it still dispatch independent tasks concurrently? | 2026-09-09 |
| `15-partial-not-credited` | Handed an interrupted review's partial containing a row that is wrong, does the fresh reviewer re-confirm the cited evidence — or credit the row and pass a criterion the code fails? | **not yet run** |
| `16-superseded-report` | When the cut-off landed after the report was written and the retry passes, is the superseded `CHANGES REQUIRED` report removed — or committed with the `DONE` milestone, describing an outcome that never happened? | **not yet run** |

## `15` and `16` have not been run

Every other row in this table records a scenario whose outcome was independently
verified the first time it ran. These two have not run at all. They are seeded,
their setup is reproducible, and their expectations were derived from the rules
in `agents/reviewer.md` and `skills/implement/SKILL.md` — but a fixture whose
expectation has never been checked against a real run is a hypothesis, not a
verified outcome, and the table would lie if it implied otherwise.

They exist because the interrupted-review path had **no** behavioural coverage:
`.harness-dev/test-interrupted-review.py` asserts that the rules are present in
the instruction text and can assert nothing about whether an agent follows them.
That gap is what these two close, and closing it takes running them.

## `15` and `16`, and why neither runs alone

The two halves of what happens after `maxTurns` cuts a reviewer off, split by
where the cut-off landed.

`15` cuts before the report: a partial survives, one of its rows is wrong, and
the code genuinely fails that criterion. Run alone it rewards ignoring the
partial altogether — a reviewer that re-derives everything from zero gets the
right verdict and has thrown away the entire saving the partial exists for.

`16` cuts after the report: a complete `CHANGES REQUIRED` report survives with
no envelope behind it, its finding is a false positive of the characteristic
kind (one test file read where two were needed), and the retry passes. Run alone
it rewards deleting anything found under `.harness/reviews/` on sight, which in
`15` would destroy the input the retry depends on.

One says the leftovers are worth reading. The other says they are not worth
believing. A harness that learns only one of those is wrong in the other
direction.

## `02` and the two-cycle cap

`02` was written in B11, when the orchestrator was allowed to write code itself.
Its expectation is that contradictory criteria produce two honest attempts, each
rejected by a fresh reviewer, and then `BLOCKED` at `Review Cycles: 2`.

Run in B25, twice on clean copies, it reaches `BLOCKED` with `Review Cycles: 0`
and no subagent invoked at all. The harness now recognises that
`subtract(10, 3)` cannot return both `7` and `42` before it routes anything, and
escalates rather than spending two review cycles to establish it. That is better
behaviour than the fixture asks for — but it meant the two-cycle cap, which `02`
was the only test of, stopped being tested by anything.

`08-cap-already-spent` was added rather than rewriting `02`, because a fixture
rewritten to match whatever the harness did stops discriminating. `08` starts at
the state `02` used to reach and tests the cap directly. `02` is retained for the
half of its purpose that still holds — contradictory work must not be faked green
— and its `Review Cycles: 2` line is known-stale, recorded here rather than
quietly edited.

`06` shows the same shape: B24 measured it delegating before stopping early, and
in B25 it invokes no subagent at all, twice.

Both then acquired a second purpose. `agents/orchestrator.md` §"Blocking a
milestone before any task is routed" now permits stopping before delegation only
when the blocker is *demonstrated* — computed, exhaustively checked, or quoted —
and shown not to be resolved by anything in the repository, with a decision named
for the human. `02` and `06` are the positive tests of that rule: `02` proved
`7 ≠ 42` and confirmed the repository held no overload that could distinguish the
two calls; `06` ran an exhaustive search over prime pairs. A run that escalated on
"this looks impossible" without that work would now be wrong, and these two are
where that shows up.

## `11` and `12`, and why neither runs alone

They are a pair in the way `03` and `04` are a pair, and for a sharper reason:
each one, run by itself, rewards the behaviour the other exists to prevent.

`11` seeds a correction that edited a file outside its finding, and a run that
reviews only the correction diff passes a milestone whose entry point prints
`$1999.00`. Run `11` alone and the lesson is *always widen* — which is what the
harness did before the 2026-08-25 measurement, at $14-55 per second cycle for
verdicts that four times in seven found nothing above `OPTIONAL`.

`12` seeds the same shape of correction confined to the files its finding named,
in a repository with nothing wrong in it. There is nothing for a widened review
to find, so the only thing widening changes is the bill — which `milestones.md`
does not record. The check is on what the reviewer was given and what it read.

**Both passed on first validation, and between them found three defects — every
one of them in the changes they were written for, none in the harness.** `11`
caught passing reviews incrementing the cycle counter, which made the two-cycle
cap unreachable; `12` caught `DONE` being recorded with every acceptance
criterion still unchecked, because moving the completion gate into the skill
carried the checking across but not the ticking. The third was found while
writing them, before either ran: reviewer invocation had moved in front of the
cap check. A fixture that finds nothing on its first run has usually been written
to agree with the code.

`12` also carries the only test of a structural change made at the same time:
a passing review completes the milestone **without an orchestrator being
invoked**. That is checkable from the session's subagents and from nothing else.
Coordinating review cost $494 against the reviewer's own $410 on the project
measured, six cycles of it spent discovering there was nothing to route.

## Reading the results

The failure that matters is not a crash. It is a confident, well-formatted report
that says `PASS` when the answer is no.

`03` is the sharpest: every test passes and every acceptance criterion genuinely
holds, so nothing in the output hints that anything is wrong. An agent that
reports `PASS` there has not failed loudly — it has produced evidence that looks
exactly like success. Treat `01` and `03` as the two that decide whether a model
can hold the `reviewer` role at all; see `docs/runtime-contract.md` §Capability
tiers for what that role has to catch, and re-run both whenever its pin changes.

## The one that tests planning

`01`-`06` all test review or execution. `07` tests **generation**, which is the
input to everything else and had no fixture until B22 — every earlier change to
milestone shape was validated by re-cutting one real project's board by hand.

Its discriminators are domain-independent, which is the point: a layered plan gives
each milestone about one component and no component recurs; a sliced plan gives each
milestone several and the same component is advanced repeatedly. That is countable
from the `### Architecture` fields on any project, not just this fixture's.

The trap is symmetrical on purpose — five components, five acceptance criteria — so
milestone *count* discriminates nothing.

## What the fixtures deliberately do not test

None of them pits one model tier against another — no fixture asks whether the
Cheap tier fails where the High tier succeeds. Such a scenario would drift with
every model release and could never separate "the harness worked" from "the model
got lucky."

**The tier-climbing worker ladder is consequently unexercised.** `06` was written
to cover it and does not: its task is impossible, and an impossible task is
precisely the one a careful orchestrator declines to delegate, so the ladder never
runs. The two properties pull against each other — a task must be *delegable and
still fail* to climb the ladder, which means genuine coding difficulty, which is
the model-dependent gradient the set deliberately avoids.

This is a known gap, recorded in `docs/implementation-plan.md` §40 as a waived
acceptance criterion rather than left implicit. It was accepted rather than closed
with a fixture that would rot.

The reason originally given for accepting it — that a misread instruction
"degrades to the previous behaviour, the orchestrator taking the task itself" — no
longer holds: §46 removed the orchestrator's ability to implement. The observed
degradation now is that the orchestrator declines to delegate and escalates to the
human instead, which is what `02` and `06` both did when last run.
