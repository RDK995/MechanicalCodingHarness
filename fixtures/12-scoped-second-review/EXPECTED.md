# 12 — The correction stayed inside its finding

The negative pair to `11-correction-wandered`. The same project and the same
shape of cycle-1 correction, confined to the files the finding named, where the
correct behaviour is a **scoped** second review that passes — and a milestone
that reaches `DONE` without a coordinator being instantiated to say so.

## Why this fixture exists

Two rules meet here, both from the 2026-08-25 review-layer measurement, and both
are rules about what *not* to do:

**A second review reads the correction diff, not the milestone again.** Cycle-2
reviews cost $14-55 each on the project measured, and four of seven found
nothing above `OPTIONAL`. A harness that widens every time is safe and pays
cycle-1 prices forever, so `11` alone would teach exactly the wrong lesson: it
rewards widening, and nothing would notice a run that widened always.

**A passing review needs no orchestrator.** Coordinating review cost $494
against the reviewer's own $410, and six cycles instantiated a coordinator to
find there was nothing to route. The skill now invokes the reviewer, applies the
completion gate itself — count the per-criterion rows against the criteria,
confirm nothing above `OPTIONAL` remains — and records `DONE`. This is the
fixture where that path runs.

## Setup

The milestone is seeded at `Status: REVIEW` with `Review Cycles: 1`. Cycle 1
graded all three acceptance criteria `PASS` and raised one IMPORTANT finding
against `receipt/parse.py` and `tests/test_parse.py`: `"1.2.3"`, `"1.234"` and
`"1.23"` all returned 123, because the fractional part was stripped of separators
and truncated rather than checked. `requirements.md` requires that an unparseable
amount is an error rather than a zero or a skip.

The correction is correct and confined. It validates the fractional part, and
brings two tests with it — `"1.2.3"` and `"1.234"` — so the criterion the
finding rested on is now covered rather than asserted. `### Review` records both
changed files, both named by the finding, and a `Pre-correction:` ref — the
`M1 implementation` commit, which the setup substitutes. **`git diff
<Pre-correction> HEAD` is what a scoped review is scoped to**; without the ref
there is no correction diff and the review must read the whole milestone.

**The rest of the repository is genuinely correct**, and that is load-bearing:
there is nothing here for a widened review to find, so the only difference a
widened review makes is its bill.

- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` → 6 tests, `OK`.
- `python3 -m receipt receipt.txt` → `$19.99`, `$0.07`, `$5.00`,
  `TOTAL $25.06` — matching the criterion exactly.

**Three commits on a milestone branch**, as in `11` — the shape B31's git
discipline produces, so `git diff <Pre-correction> HEAD` is the correction diff.
`pre-correction/` holds the two files as cycle 1 reviewed them.

```bash
git init -q
git add .gitignore .harness receipt.txt && git commit -qm baseline
BASE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
git checkout -qb m1-receipt          # the milestone branch the harness opens

C=$(mktemp -d)                       # outside the repo: it must not be committed
cp receipt/parse.py tests/test_parse.py "$C"/
cp pre-correction/parse.py      receipt/parse.py
cp pre-correction/test_parse.py tests/test_parse.py
rm -rf pre-correction
git add -A && git commit -qm "M1 implementation"
PRE=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

sed -e "s/BASELINE_SHA/$BASE/" -e "s/PRE_CORRECTION_SHA/$PRE/" \
  .harness/milestones.md > .harness/m.tmp
mv .harness/m.tmp .harness/milestones.md      # portable: sed -i differs on BSD and GNU

cp "$C"/parse.py      receipt/parse.py
cp "$C"/test_parse.py tests/test_parse.py
rm -rf "$C"
git add -A && git commit -qm "M1 cycle 1 correction (T4)"
```

**No patch file is seeded.** Under B31 the fix cycle no longer snapshots the tree
into `.harness/reviews/<milestone>-cycle<n>.patch`; the ref is the scope. So
`.harness/reviews/` does not exist when the run starts, which sharpens the
expectation below: a passing review must leave it that way.

## Command

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/this/repo --permission-mode acceptEdits \
  --allowedTools "Read Write Edit Bash Grep Glob Task Agent" \
  -p "/harness:implement"
```

## Expected outcome

**Mechanically checkable, in `.harness/milestones.md`:**

- `Status: DONE`.
- `### Review Cycles` is `1` — cycle 1's correction, and nothing since. The
  review that passes ends the loop and is not itself a cycle.
- All three acceptance criteria checked `[x]`.
- Cycle 2's entry under `### Review` records the verdict and the review tier.

**Mechanically checkable, in the run's subagents:**

- Exactly one `harness:reviewer` was invoked for this cycle.
- **No `harness:orchestrator` was invoked after it.** The review passed; there is
  nothing to route, and instantiating a coordinator to record a `PASS` is the
  cost this path exists to remove. The check is the presence or absence of the
  subagent in the session transcript, not a claim in the report.
- **`.harness/reviews/` does not exist.** Nothing is seeded there any more, a
  `PASS` writes no report, and the fix-cycle patch that used to live there is
  gone with the snapshot mechanism. A created directory or an `M1-cycle2.md` is
  the failure.

**Mechanically checkable, in git:**

- **One commit**, and it is the `DONE` record: the review passed, so there were
  no corrections to make, and the only thing to commit is
  `.harness/milestones.md`. `git status --porcelain` is empty at the end. The
  branch is still `m1-receipt`, unmerged and unpushed. (A run that squashes
  instead is conformant if this repository's convention plainly called for it —
  a three-commit `git init` fixture does not, so keeping is expected here.)
- The review's scope came from the `Pre-correction:` ref, not from a patch file
  — there is none to fall back on.

**Requires reading the report:**

- The review says it was scoped to the correction diff, and why — both changed
  files are named by cycle 1's finding, so nothing falsifies "nothing else
  changed".
- The completion gate is applied and *shown* to be applied: three criteria in
  the milestone, three rows in the reviewer's table, no `BLOCKER` or `IMPORTANT`
  outstanding. A run that reports `DONE` without that arithmetic has reached the
  right answer by agreeing with the reviewer, which is the one thing this
  harness never does.

## Failure modes worth recognising

- **Instantiating an orchestrator to record the `PASS`.** The failure this
  fixture exists to catch, and it looks like diligence. Nothing is wrong with
  the result; the milestone simply cost a coordinator context to write one line
  a fresh reviewer had already justified.
- **Widening anyway.** Correct outcome, cycle-1 bill. Undetectable from
  `milestones.md` — it shows up only as a reviewer that read the whole milestone
  diff when the record said it did not have to. This is why `12` is run and not
  merely assumed.
- **Finding something.** The repository is correct, so a `CHANGES REQUIRED`
  verdict here is a false positive, and an expensive one: it is the second
  cycle, so the cap is now spent and the next thing that goes wrong escalates to
  a human on a milestone that was finished. `OPTIONAL` findings are fine and
  block nothing; anything graded above that is the failure.
- **Passing on the reviewer's say-so.** The gate is arithmetic on the
  per-criterion table, not deference to the verdict line. A `PASS` whose table
  omits a criterion must be treated as `CHANGES REQUIRED` — that is precisely
  the shape `01-requirement-violation` catches, and it must not be reintroduced
  by moving the gate into the skill.
- **Skipping cycle 2.** The corrections would then land unreviewed. The
  measurement that produced scoping also found a review of a single correction
  catching a real `BLOCKER` for $1.98 — corrections carry their own defects, and
  scoping is what makes reviewing them affordable, not a reason to stop.

## Its pair

`11-correction-wandered` is the positive: the same shape of correction, one file
outside the finding, and a review that must widen back to the whole milestone
and catch a broken entry point. Neither fixture means much alone.
